# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection. Using the ID URL parameter for the salesperson list, you can execute the SLEEP() function and make the site stall.

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration. The Green site uses a CSS tag of "Failed" instead of "Failure," causing the login failure message to not be bold if the username doesn't exist and bold if it does.

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Red

Vulnerability #1: IDOR. The salesperson area allows users to access page IDs they aren't supposed to, such as "Testy McTesterson" and "Lazy Lazyman," which are not meant to be public. The other sites prevent you from accessing these restricted IDs by redirecting you to the salesperson page.

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work

I could not find a way of getting the admin credentials, since the SQLi vulnerability in the blue site prevents me from dumping the contents of the user table via a "Database Query Failed" error message. Thus, I had trouble executing the last three tasks.
