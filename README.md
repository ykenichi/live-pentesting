# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection. Using the ID URL parameter for the salesperson list, you can execute the SLEEP() function and make the site stall.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation. Session IDs aren't regenerated when logging in.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration. The Green site uses a CSS tag of "Failed" instead of "Failure," causing the login failure message to not be bold if the username doesn't exist and bold if it does.

Vulnerability #2: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Both the name and feedback fields aren't sanitized, allowing attackers to embed scripts into the fields that will trigger when the admin tries to view them.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: IDOR. The salesperson area allows users to access page IDs they aren't supposed to, such as "Testy McTesterson" and "Lazy Lazyman," which are not meant to be public.

Vulnerability #2: CSRF. The edit pages don't check for CSRF tokens.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work

I could not find a way of getting the admin credentials, since the SQLi vulnerability in the blue site prevents me from dumping the contents of the user table via a "Database Query Failed" error message. Thus, I couldn't find three of the vulnerabilities until they were provided.
